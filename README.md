# Euler.py

Revisiting Project Euler, this time in Python.

Why?

* Practice Python
* Practice FP
* Practice FP in Python (trickier than it sounds)
* Re-enable my stagnant brain
* Have fun
* Remember maths stuff I have long forgotten
* Build a small standard library of stuff for other Python projects

The standard library I mentioned in in the `euler` directory. In particular
`euler/iter.py` contains a lot of stuff that's missing or hard to find in Python,
even in the lovely `itertools` module and recipes or the `collections` module.
